### My story

My greatest inspiration is my Autistic son who was kicked out of three elementary schools, homeschooled 2nd through 5th grades, and bullied by students and teachers alike at a public school 6th through 7th grades before he settled at a charter school where they teach the whole student in 8th and 9th grades.  Because of COVID, he is homeschooling again, he is thriving academically, but suffering terribly, socially and emotionally as he prepares to enter 10th grade.  
I am passionate about serving at-risk youth and families because of the failures of public education we have experienced as a family.  Providing all students and families with choice and voice to meet our children’s social-emotional learning and academic needs should not be a negotiation.  As a data scientist focusing on educational research, I feel I can be an instrument of greater change for more children than in the classroom.
